# Passive Piglins

### Pacify Piglins while holding a specific item!

Gold armour be gone! You can wear whatever you like while conversing with Piglins.

Just make sure to be holding a Piglin totem! (configurable in JSON).

### Trade in style!
Piglins are no longer satisfied with gold alone.

Craft one gold ingot into a Piglin coin.

### A new tier of trades for our piggy friends!
There's a new tier of trade!

Give a Piglin the gift of a lifetime and they'll give you some powerful items in return.
